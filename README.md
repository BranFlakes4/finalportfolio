This is a collection of my favorite/best projects from my time in Coding & Computer Science. This includes coding projects, podcasts, presentations, etc.

# Coding

Below is a collection of coding projects I completed through 11th and 12th grade which I believe to be the best representation of my growth as a coder. 
They include a link to the project alongside a brief blurb about why I think they are significant.



11th Grade

Shooting Star 
Link: https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-shooting-star/5341330834243584
Blurb: Shooting star was the first project I put effort into beyond what was required. 
A lot of this was actually messing around with math and JS to see what cool things I could make happen. I'm quite proud of the perspective warping I made happen with exponential functions, and the timing of the explosion.

Make it Rain
Link: https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-make-it-rain/4604223538905088
Blurb: Make it Rain was my first passion project of sorts. Yes, it was required for the class, but I really went above and beyond with this one.
I dove into all sorts of different functions to experiment with randomness, mouse functions, and visual effects. I'm actually still really proud of this one to this day, even if it's quite goofy.

Event Invite
Link: https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-event-invite/5913789100769280
Blurb: This was the first time I really tried to take any risks with HTML. It definitely wasn't my favorite language, and I remain ambivalent about it to this day.
I at least tried to have some fun designing a purposely bad website, which ironically made me better at understanding CCS principles.



12th Grade

War
Link: https://editor.p5js.org/BranFlakes4/sketches/GmtbhKimn
Blurb: This is probably the most advanced thing I made when it came to raw coding this year. This year was actually pretty important to me discovering that my passions lie with computer science a lot more than coding.
I'm still quite proud of this War game though, but not nearly as proud as some of the more artistic creations I made this year.

Mica dress
Link: https://editor.p5js.org/BranFlakes4/sketches/TZwmg_QoQ
Blurb: I never bothered to title this piece but frankly I'm not sure what to call it. This was actually the result of me just messing around with the cards I designed for War, but I'm pretty happy with the outcome.
It follows in the spirit of Shooting Star project, and is emblematic of my preference for using coding as an artform rather than a practical tool.

Battleship
Link (Video Demo): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1almJ3kH-OnVdqxb7WbRLuf6cjSzf34zk
Blurb: I decided to return to my old passion of Minecraft redstone for one project this year, and I had a blast.
I find that my brain understand the physicality and three dimensionality of redstone a lot better than most coding languages. Though I didn't fully complete this one, I'm still very proud of the final result.

"Stop Motion" Rise of the Resistance Animation:
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpbBzD0-2XM
Blurb: This was probably the most intensive project I worked on throughout my two years of coding here at Cannon. This was a combination of learning several different programs (Blender, Stud.io, Mecabricks, etc.).
Fueled by a passion for the Rise of the Resistance dark ride, I was inspired to recreate it out of LEGO. This was a combination of physical models, digital designs, attempting to replicate real sets in LEGO, and more.
I continued to work on the animation a little more than what is shown in the above video, but this was the final render I did. All-in-all this is the coding project I'm most proud of.


# Computer Science

Below is a collection of computer science projects I completed through 11th and 12th grade which I believe to be the best representation of my growth as a studier of computer science.
They include a link to the project alongside a brief blurb about why I think they are significant.



11th Grade

Digitized Tattoos Presentation
Link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19O-PvTr81_opCCxrG-FtraVMQUnlIlU2fFBg-tBkElw/edit?usp=sharing
Blurb: This was one of the few presentations I gave in 11th grade, but was also one of the first times I dove into researching a topic I found intriguing.
Though this project itself may not be the most impressive, it served as a springboard for some of my best work later in my C+CS career.

Cryptocurrency Podcast Series
Links: https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WoWLROKUo9N9I8qruD4pq https://open.spotify.com/episode/52Pu3gbZpy1UOSvcVThBFn
Blurb: These two podcast episodes were the start of my fascination with the medium. I believe my best projects were my OpenEx podcasts in 12th grade, and they would not exist without this duology.
Through this project I learned many different skills for making podcasts, and did more research for a project than ever before in this class.
I'm not terribly happy with the audio quality or pacing, but it's still the highlight of my 11th grade year in coding.



12th Grade

Amazon's Monopolistic Practices Presentation
Link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UCdD0VNAtlOkhtD-99pn27LC_4tVwLKhUZmrzBB9v1Y/edit?usp=sharing
Blurb: I'll be honest, I was pushing the limits of an OpenEx project with this one. I kind of just wanted to go on an anticapitalist rant for ten minutes.
I did, however, do a decent amount of research into the ways Amazon designs their website and other programs to help them retain a monopoly on delivery services.
I consider myself a pretty good presenter, so I think I did a good job of getting the relevant information across to my audience, though I would soon return to a format I found much more effective.

Microsoft-Activision Blizzard Merger Podcast
Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xprAPZKI7WwjoC7r-xD8ZL1c93AA8D6h/view?usp=sharing
Blurb: This was were my passions really ended up being this year. Researching a topic I was fascinated by and condenscing the information I found and opinions I held into a ten minute podcast was a joy.
Though this was substantially better than the Cryptocurrency Series, there was still a decent amount of room to grow, specifically in pacing.
I think that I did a very good job of fixing this with my followup OpenEx podcast.

maia arson crimew Podcast
Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bg4RpotZg5SnjwQQOf7jbBdUFMCSv12s/view?usp=sharing
Blurb: This was the cream of the crop. I'm so proud of both my work on this podcast and the final project. I found a topic that I was passionate about and could be used to learn interesting facts about cybersecurity.
It also helped that the topic lended itself to a comedic tone. I had my format down at this point, so I really let the finer details shine through.
This is by far the coolest thing I got to do for these classes, and it has inspired me to explore this format into my college career.
