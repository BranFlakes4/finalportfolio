Below is a collection of coding projects I completed through 11th and 12th grade which I believe to be the best representation of my growth as a coder. 
They include a link to the project alongside a brief blurb about why I think they are significant.



11th Grade

Shooting Star

Blurb: Shooting star was the first project I put effort into beyond what was required. 
A lot of this was actually messing around with math and JS to see what cool things I could make happen. I'm quite proud of the perspective warping I made happen with exponential functions, and the timing of the explosion.

Make it Rain
Link: https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-make-it-rain/4604223538905088
Blurb: Make it Rain was my first passion project of sorts. Yes, it was required for the class, but I really went above and beyond with this one.
I dove into all sorts of different functions to experiment with randomness, mouse functions, and visual effects. I'm actually still really proud of this one to this day, even if it's quite goofy.

Event Invite

Blurb: This was the first time I really tried to take any risks with HTML. It definitely wasn't my favorite language, and I remain ambivalent about it to this day.
I at least tried to have some fun designing a purposely bad website, which ironically made me better at understanding CCS principles.



12th Grade

War
Link: https://editor.p5js.org/BranFlakes4/sketches/GmtbhKimn
Blurb: This is probably the most advanced thing I made when it came to raw coding this year. This year was actually pretty important to me discovering that my passions lie with computer science a lot more than coding.
I'm still quite proud of this War game though, but not nearly as proud as some of the more artistic creations I made this year.

Mica dress

Blurb: I never bothered to title this piece but frankly I'm not sure what to call it. This was actually the result of me just messing around with the cards I designed for War, but I'm pretty happy with the outcome.
It follows in the spirit of Shooting Star project, and is emblematic of my preference for using coding as an artform rather than a practical tool.

Battleship
Link (Video Demo): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1almJ3kH-OnVdqxb7WbRLuf6cjSzf34zk
Blurb: I decided to return to my old passion of Minecraft redstone for one project this year, and I had a blast.
I find that my brain understand the physicality and three dimensionality of redstone a lot better than most coding languages. Though I didn't fully complete this one, I'm still very proud of the final result.

"Stop Motion" Rise of the Resistance Animation:
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpbBzD0-2XM
Blurb: This was probably the most intensive project I worked on throughout my two years of coding here at Cannon. This was a combination of learning several different programs (Blender, Stud.io, Mecabricks, etc.).
