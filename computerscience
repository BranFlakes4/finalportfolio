Below is a collection of computer science projects I completed through 11th and 12th grade which I believe to be the best representation of my growth as a studier of computer science.
They include a link to the project alongside a brief blurb about why I think they are significant.



11th Grade

Digitized Tattoos Presentation

Blurb: This was one of the few presentations I gave in 11th grade, but was also one of the first times I dove into researching a topic I found intriguing.
Though this project itself may not be the most impressive, it served as a springboard for some of my best work later in my C+CS career.

Cryptocurrency Podcast Series

Blurb: These two podcast episodes were the start of my fascination with the medium. I believe my best projects were my OpenEx podcasts in 12th grade, and they would not exist without this duology.
Through this project I learned many different skills for making podcasts, and did more research for a project than ever before in this class.
I'm not terribly happy with the audio quality or pacing, but it's still the highlight of my 11th grade year in coding.



12th Grade

Amazon's Monopolistic Practices Presentation

Blurb: I'll be honest, I was pushing the limits of an OpenEx project with this one. I kind of just wanted to go on an anticapitalist rant for ten minutes.
I did, however, do a decent amount of research into the ways Amazon designs their website and other programs to help them retain a monopoly on delivery services.
I consider myself a pretty good presenter, so I think I did a good job of getting the relevant information across to my audience, though I would soon return to a format I found much more effective.

Microsoft-Activision Blizzard Merger Podcast

Blurb: This was were my passions really ended up being this year. Researching a topic I was fascinated by and condenscing the information I found and opinions I held into a ten minute podcast was a joy.
Though this was substantially better than the Cryptocurrency Series, there was still a decent amount of room to grow, specifically in pacing.
I think that I did a very good job of fixing this with my followup OpenEx podcast.

Blurb: This was the cream of the crop. I'm so proud of both my work on this podcast and the final project. I found a topic that I was passionate about and could be used to learn interesting facts about cybersecurity.
It also helped that the topic lended itself to a comedic tone. I had my format down at this point, so I really let the finer details shine through.
This is by far the coolest thing I got to do for these classes, and it has inspired me to explore this format into my college career.
